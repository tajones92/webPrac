A repository for foolin' with web development things...

This is a space where I will be playing around with some web development things.

Just for funsies.

I'm editing a README file.  If all goes well, Sourcetree should let me know something about this...

I'm editing the README again.  Then I'll try to write over it, make a mistake, and try to recover.
